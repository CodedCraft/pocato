## Introduction

Welcome to Tocapo, a simple command-line interface tool designed to help you manage your tasks and 
stay organized. The current release is a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) and consists of just the core 
task manager application (todo app). The vision is to tightly integrate this task manager with the 
Pomodoro Technique and a calendar, creating a comprehensive productivity ecosystem. There are big 
plans for the future, including web and desktop applications, so stay tuned for exciting updates!

## Features

- **Task Creation:** Easily create tasks with a title.
- **Task List:** View a list of all your tasks, including their status.
- **Task Completion**: Mark task as complete.
- **Task Deletion:** Remove tasks that are no longer needed.

## Installation

To use Tocapo, you need to have rust cargo installed on your system. 
1. Install with cargo:
   ```bash
   cargo install tocapo
   ```
2. Run tocapo with the 'help' command to learn all commands (or read [Usage](#Usage) section below):
    ```bash
    tocapo help
    ```

## Usage
Here are all commands to get you started:

- `add <Enter task name>`: Create a new task.
- `show`: Show all tasks the database.
- `show <Enter task ID>`: Show a specific task.
- `finish <Enter task ID>`: Check off a specific task.
- `delete <Enter task ID>`: Delete a specific task.

## Feedback
I value your feedback! If you encounter any issues, have suggestions, or want to report a bug, 
please feel free to create an issue in the GitHub repository.

## Tech Stack

The CLI Task Manager App is built using the following technologies and tools:

- **Rust Programming Language:** Rust was chosen for its strong emphasis on safety, speed, and 
performance, making it an excellent choice for building a reliable task manager.

- **Clap for CLI Parsing:** Currently, Clap library is used for command-line parsing.
Clap simplifies command-line argument parsing and provides a great user experience. Custom solutions 
may be explored in the future for better integration.

- **SQLite as Database:** The application currently stores task data in an SQLite database. This 
choice was made for its simplicity and portability. Plans include migrating to PostgreSQL in the 
future to support a distributed task management system.

Stay tuned for updates as I continue to enhance and optimize the technology stack to provide you 
with a better task management experience.

## Roadmap

While this MVP CLI version provides only the essential task management functionality, exciting plans 
are in store for the future:

- **Web Application:** A user-friendly web application with an intuitive interface is in the works.
- **Desktop Application:** A desktop version is planned for even more convenience.
- **Sync and Backup:** Stay organized across devices with task synchronization and data backup.
- **Customization:** Customize your task manager with themes and categories.
